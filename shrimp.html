		<h1> ONE-POT GARLICKY SHRIMP AND BROCCOLI </h1>

        <h5>SOURCE: https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?<br>url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F<br>sites%2F44%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Fone-pot-garlicky-shrimp-and-broccoli.jpg</h5>
		<h2> BENEFITS </h2>
		<p>•	Broccoli is a fairly low-carb vegetable with most of its carbohydrates coming from fiber, a good complex carb. It’s high in water content, but also surprisingly high in protein for a veggie. Broccoli is also full of vitamins and minerals including vitamin C, vitamin K1, folate, potassium, manganese, and iron.<br><br>
		•	Shrimp is a low-calorie, no-carb, high-protein shellfish that can also throughout a long list of vitamins and minerals—think plenty of selenium, vitamin B12, and iron, among many others. It’s also packed with iodine, antioxidants, and the ever-important omega 3s we all need for proper brain and heart health!<br></p>

		<h2> RECIPE </h2>
		<h3> SERVINGS: 4 <br><br>

		<br><hr>
		<h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
		<p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add half the garlic and cook until beginning to brown, about 1 minute.

Increase heat to medium-high and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pot. Add the remaining garlic and cook until beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add shrimp and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; cook, stirring, until the shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.
